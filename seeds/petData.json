She really does NOT like to be picked up or restrained as she finds this quite scary. A quiet adult home would be the best placement for this pretty girl. Daisy would benefit if she could have a quiet room to herself if possible while she adjusts to her new surroundings. A place to hide within this quiet space would be ideal until she feels save to venture out to explore."

Our vets have checked it out and it does not cause her any discomfort, though it will be something she has for the rest of her life. Xena would do well in a home with another cat companion, however, she does enjoy taking to to herself as well. Her ideal home is one without young children as she does not liked to be grabbed or chased, and instead enjoys coming to her friends for affections in her own time."
